the sonnets

by william shakespeare

from fairest creatures we desire increase
that thereby beauty's rose might never die
but as the riper should by time decease
his tender heir might bear his memory
but thou contracted to thine own bright eyes
feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel
making a famine where abundance lies
thy self thy foe to thy sweet self too cruel
thou that art now the world's fresh ornament
and only herald to the gaudy spring
within thine own bud buriest thy content
and tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding
pity the world or else this glutton be
to eat the world's due by the grave and thee

when forty winters shall besiege thy brow
and dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field
thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now
will be a tattered weed of small worth held  
then being asked where all thy beauty lies
where all the treasure of thy lusty days;
to say within thine own deep sunken eyes
were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise
how much more praise deserved thy beauty's use
if thou couldst answer 'this fair child of mine
shall sum my count and make my old excuse'
proving his beauty by succession thine
this were to be new made when thou art old
and see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold

look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest
now is the time that face should form another
whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest
thou dost beguile the world unbless some mother
for where is she so fair whose uneared womb
disdains the tillage of thy husbandry
or who is he so fond will be the tomb
of his self-love to stop posterity  
thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee
calls back the lovely april of her prime
so thou through windows of thine age shalt see
despite of wrinkles this thy golden time
but if thou live remembered not to be
die single and thine image dies with thee

unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend
upon thy self thy beauty's legacy
nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend
and being frank she lends to those are free
then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse
the bounteous largess given thee to give
profitless usurer why dost thou use
so great a sum of sums yet canst not live
for having traffic with thy self alone
thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive
then how when nature calls thee to be gone
what acceptable audit canst thou leave  
thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee
which used lives th' executor to be

those hours that with gentle work did frame
the lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell
will play the tyrants to the very same
and that unfair which fairly doth excel
for never-resting time leads summer on
to hideous winter and confounds him there
sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone
beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where
then were not summer's distillation left
a liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass
beauty's effect with beauty were bereft
nor it nor no remembrance what it was
but flowers distilled though they with winter meet
leese but their show their substance still lives sweet
  
then let not winter's ragged hand deface
in thee thy summer ere thou be distilled
make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place
with beauty's treasure ere it be self-killed
that use is not forbidden usury
which happies those that pay the willing loan;
that's for thy self to breed another thee
or ten times happier be it ten for one
ten times thy self were happier than thou art
if ten of thine ten times refigured thee
then what could death do if thou shouldst depart
leaving thee living in posterity
be not self-willed for thou art much too fair
to be death's conquest and make worms thine heir

lo in the orient when the gracious light
lifts up his burning head each under eye
doth homage to his new-appearing sight
serving with looks his sacred majesty  
and having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill
resembling strong youth in his middle age
yet mortal looks adore his beauty still
attending on his golden pilgrimage
but when from highmost pitch with weary car
like feeble age he reeleth from the day
the eyes fore duteous now converted are
from his low tract and look another way
so thou thy self out-going in thy noon
unlooked on diest unless thou get a son

music to hear why hear'st thou music sadly
sweets with sweets war not joy delights in joy
why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly
or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy
if the true concord of well-tuned sounds
by unions married do offend thine ear
they do but sweetly chide thee who confounds
in singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear  
mark how one string sweet husband to another
strikes each in each by mutual ordering;
resembling sire and child and happy mother
who all in one one pleasing note do sing
whose speechless song being many seeming one
sings this to thee 'thou single wilt prove none'

is it for fear to wet a widow's eye
that thou consum'st thy self in single life
ah if thou issueless shalt hap to die
the world will wail thee like a makeless wife
the world will be thy widow and still weep
that thou no form of thee hast left behind
when every private widow well may keep
by children's eyes her husband's shape in mind
look what an unthrift in the world doth spend
shifts but his place for still the world enjoys it;
but beauty's waste hath in the world an end
and kept unused the user so destroys it  
no love toward others in that bosom sits
that on himself such murd'rous shame commits

for shame deny that thou bear'st love to any
who for thy self art so unprovident
grant if thou wilt thou art beloved of many
but that thou none lov'st is most evident
for thou art so possessed with murd'rous hate
that 'gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire
seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
which to repair should be thy chief desire
o change thy thought that i may change my mind
shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love
be as thy presence is gracious and kind
or to thy self at least kind-hearted prove
make thee another self for love of me
that beauty still may live in thine or thee
  
as fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow'st
in one of thine from that which thou departest
and that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st
thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest
herein lives wisdom beauty and increase
without this folly age and cold decay
if all were minded so the times should cease
and threescore year would make the world away
let those whom nature hath not made for store
harsh featureless and rude barrenly perish
look whom she best endowed she gave thee more;
which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish
she carved thee for her seal and meant thereby
thou shouldst print more not let that copy die

when i do count the clock that tells the time
and see the brave day sunk in hideous night
when i behold the violet past prime
and sable curls all silvered o'er with white  
when lofty trees i see barren of leaves
which erst from heat did canopy the herd
and summer's green all girded up in sheaves
borne on the bier with white and bristly beard
then of thy beauty do i question make
that thou among the wastes of time must go
since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
and die as fast as they see others grow
and nothing 'gainst time's scythe can make defence
save breed to brave him when he takes thee hence

o that you were your self but love you are
no longer yours than you your self here live
against this coming end you should prepare
and your sweet semblance to some other give
so should that beauty which you hold in lease
find no determination then you were
your self again after your self's decease
when your sweet issue your sweet form should bear  
who lets so fair a house fall to decay
which husbandry in honour might uphold
against the stormy gusts of winter's day
and barren rage of death's eternal cold
o none but unthrifts dear my love you know
you had a father let your son say so

not from the stars do i my judgement pluck
and yet methinks i have astronomy
but not to tell of good or evil luck
of plagues of dearths or seasons' quality
nor can i fortune to brief minutes tell;
pointing to each his thunder rain and wind
or say with princes if it shall go well
by oft predict that i in heaven find
but from thine eyes my knowledge i derive
and constant stars in them i read such art
as truth and beauty shall together thrive
if from thy self to store thou wouldst convert  
or else of thee this i prognosticate
thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date

when i consider every thing that grows
holds in perfection but a little moment
that this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
whereon the stars in secret influence comment
when i perceive that men as plants increase
cheered and checked even by the self-same sky
vaunt in their youthful sap at height decrease
and wear their brave state out of memory
then the conceit of this inconstant stay
sets you most rich in youth before my sight
where wasteful time debateth with decay
to change your day of youth to sullied night
and all in war with time for love of you
as he takes from you i engraft you new
  
but wherefore do not you a mightier way
make war upon this bloody tyrant time
and fortify your self in your decay
with means more blessed than my barren rhyme
now stand you on the top of happy hours
and many maiden gardens yet unset
with virtuous wish would bear you living flowers
much liker than your painted counterfeit
so should the lines of life that life repair
which this time's pencil or my pupil pen
neither in inward worth nor outward fair
can make you live your self in eyes of men
to give away your self keeps your self still
and you must live drawn by your own sweet skill

who will believe my verse in time to come
if it were filled with your most high deserts
though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb
which hides your life and shows not half your parts  
if i could write the beauty of your eyes
and in fresh numbers number all your graces
the age to come would say this poet lies
such heavenly touches ne'er touched earthly faces
so should my papers yellowed with their age
be scorned like old men of less truth than tongue
and your true rights be termed a poet's rage
and stretched metre of an antique song
but were some child of yours alive that time
you should live twice in it and in my rhyme

shall i compare thee to a summer's day
thou art more lovely and more temperate
rough winds do shake the darling buds of may
and summer's lease hath all too short a date
sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines
and often is his gold complexion dimmed
and every fair from fair sometime declines
by chance or nature's changing course untrimmed  
but thy eternal summer shall not fade
nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st
nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade
when in eternal lines to time thou grow'st
so long as men can breathe or eyes can see
so long lives this and this gives life to thee

devouring time blunt thou the lion's paws
and make the earth devour her own sweet brood
pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws
and burn the long-lived phoenix in her blood
make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet'st
and do whate'er thou wilt swift-footed time
to the wide world and all her fading sweets
but i forbid thee one most heinous crime
o carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow
nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen
him in thy course untainted do allow
for beauty's pattern to succeeding men  
yet do thy worst old time despite thy wrong
my love shall in my verse ever live young

a woman's face with nature's own hand painted
hast thou the master mistress of my passion
a woman's gentle heart but not acquainted
with shifting change as is false women's fashion
an eye more bright than theirs less false in rolling
gilding the object whereupon it gazeth
a man in hue all hues in his controlling
which steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth
and for a woman wert thou first created
till nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting
and by addition me of thee defeated
by adding one thing to my purpose nothing
but since she pricked thee out for women's pleasure
mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure
  
so is it not with me as with that muse
stirred by a painted beauty to his verse
who heaven it self for ornament doth use
and every fair with his fair doth rehearse
making a couplement of proud compare
with sun and moon with earth and sea's rich gems
with april's first-born flowers and all things rare
that heaven's air in this huge rondure hems
o let me true in love but truly write
and then believe me my love is as fair
as any mother's child though not so bright
as those gold candles fixed in heaven's air
let them say more that like of hearsay well
i will not praise that purpose not to sell

my glass shall not persuade me i am old
so long as youth and thou are of one date
but when in thee time's furrows i behold
then look i death my days should expiate  
for all that beauty that doth cover thee
is but the seemly raiment of my heart
which in thy breast doth live as thine in me
how can i then be elder than thou art
o therefore love be of thyself so wary
as i not for my self but for thee will
bearing thy heart which i will keep so chary
as tender nurse her babe from faring ill
presume not on thy heart when mine is slain
thou gav'st me thine not to give back again

as an unperfect actor on the stage
who with his fear is put beside his part
or some fierce thing replete with too much rage
whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart;
so i for fear of trust forget to say
the perfect ceremony of love's rite
and in mine own love's strength seem to decay
o'ercharged with burthen of mine own love's might  
o let my looks be then the eloquence
and dumb presagers of my speaking breast
who plead for love and look for recompense
more than that tongue that more hath more expressed
o learn to read what silent love hath writ
to hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit

mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled
thy beauty's form in table of my heart
my body is the frame wherein 'tis held
and perspective it is best painter's art
for through the painter must you see his skill
to find where your true image pictured lies
which in my bosom's shop is hanging still
that hath his windows glazed with thine eyes
now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done
mine eyes have drawn thy shape and thine for me
are windows to my breast where-through the sun
delights to peep to gaze therein on thee;  
yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art
they draw but what they see know not the heart

let those who are in favour with their stars
of public honour and proud titles boast
whilst i whom fortune of such triumph bars
unlooked for joy in that i honour most;
great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread
but as the marigold at the sun's eye
and in themselves their pride lies buried
for at a frown they in their glory die
the painful warrior famoused for fight
after a thousand victories once foiled
is from the book of honour razed quite
and all the rest forgot for which he toiled
then happy i that love and am beloved
where i may not remove nor be removed
  
lord of my love to whom in vassalage
thy merit hath my duty strongly knit;
to thee i send this written embassage
to witness duty not to show my wit
duty so great which wit so poor as mine
may make seem bare in wanting words to show it;
but that i hope some good conceit of thine
in thy soul's thought all naked will bestow it
till whatsoever star that guides my moving
points on me graciously with fair aspect
and puts apparel on my tattered loving
to show me worthy of thy sweet respect
then may i dare to boast how i do love thee
till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me

weary with toil i haste me to my bed
the dear respose for limbs with travel tired
but then begins a journey in my head
to work my mind when body's work's expired  
for then my thoughts from far where i abide
intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee
and keep my drooping eyelids open wide
looking on darkness which the blind do see
save that my soul's imaginary sight
presents thy shadow to my sightless view
which like a jewel hung in ghastly night
makes black night beauteous and her old face new
lo thus by day my limbs by night my mind
for thee and for my self no quiet find

how can i then return in happy plight
that am debarred the benefit of rest
when day's oppression is not eased by night
but day by night and night by day oppressed
and each though enemies to either's reign
do in consent shake hands to torture me
the one by toil the other to complain
how far i toil still farther off from thee  
i tell the day to please him thou art bright
and dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven
so flatter i the swart-complexioned night
when sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even
but day doth daily draw my sorrows longer
and night doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger

when in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes
i all alone beweep my outcast state
and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries
and look upon my self and curse my fate
wishing me like to one more rich in hope
featured like him like him with friends possessed
desiring this man's art and that man's scope
with what i most enjoy contented least
yet in these thoughts my self almost despising
haply i think on thee and then my state
like to the lark at break of day arising
from sullen earth sings hymns at heaven's gate  
for thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings
that then i scorn to change my state with kings

when to the sessions of sweet silent thought
i summon up remembrance of things past
i sigh the lack of many a thing i sought
and with old woes new wail my dear time's waste
then can i drown an eye unused to flow
for precious friends hid in death's dateless night
and weep afresh love's long since cancelled woe
and moan th' expense of many a vanished sight
then can i grieve at grievances foregone
and heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
the sad account of fore-bemoaned moan
which i new pay as if not paid before
but if the while i think on thee dear friend
all losses are restored and sorrows end
  
thy bosom is endeared with all hearts
which i by lacking have supposed dead
and there reigns love and all love's loving parts
and all those friends which i thought buried
how many a holy and obsequious tear
hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye
as interest of the dead which now appear
but things removed that hidden in thee lie
thou art the grave where buried love doth live
hung with the trophies of my lovers gone
who all their parts of me to thee did give
that due of many now is thine alone
their images i loved i view in thee
and thou all they hast all the all of me

if thou survive my well-contented day
when that churl death my bones with dust shall cover
and shalt by fortune once more re-survey
these poor rude lines of thy deceased lover  
compare them with the bett'ring of the time
and though they be outstripped by every pen
reserve them for my love not for their rhyme
exceeded by the height of happier men
o then vouchsafe me but this loving thought
'had my friend's muse grown with this growing age
a dearer birth than this his love had brought
to march in ranks of better equipage
but since he died and poets better prove
theirs for their style i'll read his for his love'

full many a glorious morning have i seen
flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye
kissing with golden face the meadows green;
gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy
anon permit the basest clouds to ride
with ugly rack on his celestial face
and from the forlorn world his visage hide
stealing unseen to west with this disgrace  
even so my sun one early morn did shine
with all triumphant splendour on my brow
but out alack he was but one hour mine
the region cloud hath masked him from me now
yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth
suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth

why didst thou promise such a beauteous day
and make me travel forth without my cloak
to let base clouds o'ertake me in my way
hiding thy brav'ry in their rotten smoke
'tis not enough that through the cloud thou break
to dry the rain on my storm-beaten face
for no man well of such a salve can speak
that heals the wound and cures not the disgrace
nor can thy shame give physic to my grief
though thou repent yet i have still the loss
th' offender's sorrow lends but weak relief
to him that bears the strong offence's cross  
ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds
and they are rich and ransom all ill deeds



no more be grieved at that which thou hast done
roses have thorns and silver fountains mud
clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun
and loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud
all men make faults and even i in this
authorizing thy trespass with compare
my self corrupting salving thy amiss
excusing thy sins more than thy sins are
for to thy sensual fault i bring in sense
thy adverse party is thy advocate
and 'gainst my self a lawful plea commence
such civil war is in my love and hate
that i an accessary needs must be
to that sweet thief which sourly robs from me
  
let me confess that we two must be twain
although our undivided loves are one
so shall those blots that do with me remain
without thy help by me be borne alone
in our two loves there is but one respect
though in our lives a separable spite
which though it alter not love's sole effect
yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight
i may not evermore acknowledge thee
lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame
nor thou with public kindness honour me
unless thou take that honour from thy name
but do not so i love thee in such sort
as thou being mine mine is thy good report

as a decrepit father takes delight
to see his active child do deeds of youth
so i made lame by fortune's dearest spite
take all my comfort of thy worth and truth  
for whether beauty birth or wealth or wit
or any of these all or all or more
entitled in thy parts do crowned sit
i make my love engrafted to this store
so then i am not lame poor nor despised
whilst that this shadow doth such substance give
that i in thy abundance am sufficed
and by a part of all thy glory live
look what is best that best i wish in thee
this wish i have then ten times happy me

how can my muse want subject to invent
while thou dost breathe that pour'st into my verse
thine own sweet argument too excellent
for every vulgar paper to rehearse
o give thy self the thanks if aught in me
worthy perusal stand against thy sight
for who's so dumb that cannot write to thee
when thou thy self dost give invention light  
be thou the tenth muse ten times more in worth
than those old nine which rhymers invocate
and he that calls on thee let him bring forth
eternal numbers to outlive long date
if my slight muse do please these curious days
the pain be mine but thine shall be the praise

o how thy worth with manners may i sing
when thou art all the better part of me
what can mine own praise to mine own self bring
and what is't but mine own when i praise thee
even for this let us divided live
and our dear love lose name of single one
that by this separation i may give
that due to thee which thou deserv'st alone
o absence what a torment wouldst thou prove
were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave
to entertain the time with thoughts of love
which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive  
and that thou teachest how to make one twain
by praising him here who doth hence remain

take all my loves my love yea take them all
what hast thou then more than thou hadst before
no love my love that thou mayst true love call
all mine was thine before thou hadst this more
then if for my love thou my love receivest
i cannot blame thee for my love thou usest
but yet be blamed if thou thy self deceivest
by wilful taste of what thy self refusest
i do forgive thy robbery gentle thief
although thou steal thee all my poverty
and yet love knows it is a greater grief
to bear greater wrong than hate's known injury
lascivious grace in whom all ill well shows
kill me with spites yet we must not be foes
  
those pretty wrongs that liberty commits
when i am sometime absent from thy heart
thy beauty and thy years full well befits
for still temptation follows where thou art
gentle thou art and therefore to be won
beauteous thou art therefore to be assailed
and when a woman woos what woman's son
will sourly leave her till he have prevailed
ay me but yet thou mightst my seat forbear
and chide thy beauty and thy straying youth
who lead thee in their riot even there
where thou art forced to break a twofold truth
hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee
thine by thy beauty being false to me

that thou hast her it is not all my grief
and yet it may be said i loved her dearly
that she hath thee is of my wailing chief
a loss in love that touches me more nearly  
loving offenders thus i will excuse ye
thou dost love her because thou know'st i love her
and for my sake even so doth she abuse me
suff'ring my friend for my sake to approve her
if i lose thee my loss is my love's gain
and losing her my friend hath found that loss
both find each other and i lose both twain
and both for my sake lay on me this cross
but here's the joy my friend and i are one
sweet flattery then she loves but me alone

when most i wink then do mine eyes best see
for all the day they view things unrespected
but when i sleep in dreams they look on thee
and darkly bright are bright in dark directed
then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright
how would thy shadow's form form happy show
to the clear day with thy much clearer light
when to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so!  
how would i say mine eyes be blessed made
by looking on thee in the living day
when in dead night thy fair imperfect shade
through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!
all days are nights to see till i see thee
and nights bright days when dreams do show thee me

if the dull substance of my flesh were thought
injurious distance should not stop my way
for then despite of space i would be brought
from limits far remote where thou dost stay
no matter then although my foot did stand
upon the farthest earth removed from thee
for nimble thought can jump both sea and land
as soon as think the place where he would be
but ah thought kills me that i am not thought
to leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone
but that so much of earth and water wrought
i must attend time's leisure with my moan  
receiving nought by elements so slow
but heavy tears badges of either's woe

the other two slight air and purging fire
are both with thee wherever i abide
the first my thought the other my desire
these present-absent with swift motion slide
for when these quicker elements are gone
in tender embassy of love to thee
my life being made of four with two alone
sinks down to death oppressed with melancholy
until life's composition be recured
by those swift messengers returned from thee
who even but now come back again assured
of thy fair health recounting it to me
this told i joy but then no longer glad
i send them back again and straight grow sad
  
mine eye and heart are at a mortal war
how to divide the conquest of thy sight
mine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar
my heart mine eye the freedom of that right
my heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie
a closet never pierced with crystal eyes
but the defendant doth that plea deny
and says in him thy fair appearance lies
to side this title is impanelled
a quest of thoughts all tenants to the heart
and by their verdict is determined
the clear eye's moiety and the dear heart's part
as thus mine eye's due is thy outward part
and my heart's right thy inward love of heart

betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took
and each doth good turns now unto the other
when that mine eye is famished for a look
or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother;  
with my love's picture then my eye doth feast
and to the painted banquet bids my heart
another time mine eye is my heart's guest
and in his thoughts of love doth share a part
so either by thy picture or my love
thy self away art present still with me
for thou not farther than my thoughts canst move
and i am still with them and they with thee
or if they sleep thy picture in my sight
awakes my heart to heart's and eye's delight

how careful was i when i took my way
each trifle under truest bars to thrust
that to my use it might unused stay
from hands of falsehood in sure wards of trust!
but thou to whom my jewels trifles are
most worthy comfort now my greatest grief
thou best of dearest and mine only care
art left the prey of every vulgar thief  
thee have i not locked up in any chest
save where thou art not though i feel thou art
within the gentle closure of my breast
from whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part
and even thence thou wilt be stol'n i fear
for truth proves thievish for a prize so dear

against that time if ever that time come
when i shall see thee frown on my defects
when as thy love hath cast his utmost sum
called to that audit by advised respects
against that time when thou shalt strangely pass
and scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye
when love converted from the thing it was
shall reasons find of settled gravity;
against that time do i ensconce me here
within the knowledge of mine own desert
and this my hand against my self uprear
to guard the lawful reasons on thy part  
to leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws
since why to love i can allege no cause

how heavy do i journey on the way
when what i seek my weary travel's end
doth teach that case and that repose to say
'thus far the miles are measured from thy friend'
the beast that bears me tired with my woe
plods dully on to bear that weight in me
as if by some instinct the wretch did know
his rider loved not speed being made from thee
the bloody spur cannot provoke him on
that sometimes anger thrusts into his hide
which heavily he answers with a groan
more sharp to me than spurring to his side
for that same groan doth put this in my mind
my grief lies onward and my joy behind
  
thus can my love excuse the slow offence
of my dull bearer when from thee i speed
from where thou art why should i haste me thence
till i return of posting is no need
o what excuse will my poor beast then find
when swift extremity can seem but slow
then should i spur though mounted on the wind
in winged speed no motion shall i know
then can no horse with my desire keep pace
therefore desire of perfect'st love being made
shall neigh no dull flesh in his fiery race
but love for love thus shall excuse my jade
since from thee going he went wilful-slow
towards thee i'll run and give him leave to go

so am i as the rich whose blessed key
can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure
the which he will not every hour survey
for blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure  
therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare
since seldom coming in that long year set
like stones of worth they thinly placed are
or captain jewels in the carcanet
so is the time that keeps you as my chest
or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide
to make some special instant special-blest
by new unfolding his imprisoned pride
blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope
being had to triumph being lacked to hope

what is your substance whereof are you made
that millions of strange shadows on you tend
since every one hath every one one shade
and you but one can every shadow lend
describe adonis and the counterfeit
is poorly imitated after you
on helen's cheek all art of beauty set
and you in grecian tires are painted new  
speak of the spring and foison of the year
the one doth shadow of your beauty show
the other as your bounty doth appear
and you in every blessed shape we know
in all external grace you have some part
but you like none none you for constant heart

o how much more doth beauty beauteous seem
by that sweet ornament which truth doth give!
the rose looks fair but fairer we it deem
for that sweet odour which doth in it live
the canker blooms have full as deep a dye
as the perfumed tincture of the roses
hang on such thorns and play as wantonly
when summer's breath their masked buds discloses
but for their virtue only is their show
they live unwooed and unrespected fade
die to themselves sweet roses do not so
of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made  
and so of you beauteous and lovely youth
when that shall vade by verse distills your truth

not marble nor the gilded monuments
of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme
but you shall shine more bright in these contents
than unswept stone besmeared with sluttish time
when wasteful war shall statues overturn
and broils root out the work of masonry
nor mars his sword nor war's quick fire shall burn
the living record of your memory
'gainst death and all-oblivious enmity
shall you pace forth your praise shall still find room
even in the eyes of all posterity
that wear this world out to the ending doom
so till the judgment that your self arise
you live in this and dwell in lovers' eyes
  
sweet love renew thy force be it not said
thy edge should blunter be than appetite
which but to-day by feeding is allayed
to-morrow sharpened in his former might
so love be thou although to-day thou fill
thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fulness
to-morrow see again and do not kill
the spirit of love with a perpetual dulness
let this sad interim like the ocean be
which parts the shore where two contracted new
come daily to the banks that when they see
return of love more blest may be the view
or call it winter which being full of care
makes summer's welcome thrice more wished more rare

being your slave what should i do but tend
upon the hours and times of your desire
i have no precious time at all to spend;
nor services to do till you require  
nor dare i chide the world-without-end hour
whilst i my sovereign watch the clock for you
nor think the bitterness of absence sour
when you have bid your servant once adieu
nor dare i question with my jealous thought
where you may be or your affairs suppose
but like a sad slave stay and think of nought
save where you are how happy you make those
so true a fool is love that in your will
though you do any thing he thinks no ill

that god forbid that made me first your slave
i should in thought control your times of pleasure
or at your hand th' account of hours to crave
being your vassal bound to stay your leisure
o let me suffer being at your beck
th' imprisoned absence of your liberty
and patience tame to sufferance bide each check
without accusing you of injury  
be where you list your charter is so strong
that you your self may privilage your time
to what you will to you it doth belong
your self to pardon of self-doing crime
i am to wait though waiting so be hell
not blame your pleasure be it ill or well

if there be nothing new but that which is
hath been before how are our brains beguiled
which labouring for invention bear amis
the second burthen of a former child!
o that record could with a backward look
even of five hundred courses of the sun
show me your image in some antique book
since mind at first in character was done
that i might see what the old world could say
to this composed wonder of your frame
whether we are mended or whether better they
or whether revolution be the same  
o sure i am the wits of former days
to subjects worse have given admiring praise

like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore
so do our minutes hasten to their end
each changing place with that which goes before
in sequent toil all forwards do contend
nativity once in the main of light
crawls to maturity wherewith being crowned
crooked eclipses 'gainst his glory fight
and time that gave doth now his gift confound
time doth transfix the flourish set on youth
and delves the parallels in beauty's brow
feeds on the rarities of nature's truth
and nothing stands but for his scythe to mow
and yet to times in hope my verse shall stand
praising thy worth despite his cruel hand
  
is it thy will thy image should keep open
my heavy eyelids to the weary night
dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken
while shadows like to thee do mock my sight
is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee
so far from home into my deeds to pry
to find out shames and idle hours in me
the scope and tenure of thy jealousy
o no thy love though much is not so great
it is my love that keeps mine eye awake
mine own true love that doth my rest defeat
to play the watchman ever for thy sake
for thee watch i whilst thou dost wake elsewhere
from me far off with others all too near

sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye
and all my soul and all my every part;
and for this sin there is no remedy
it is so grounded inward in my heart  
methinks no face so gracious is as mine
no shape so true no truth of such account
and for my self mine own worth do define
as i all other in all worths surmount
but when my glass shows me my self indeed
beated and chopt with tanned antiquity
mine own self-love quite contrary i read
self so self-loving were iniquity
'tis thee my self that for my self i praise
painting my age with beauty of thy days

against my love shall be as i am now
with time's injurious hand crushed and o'erworn
when hours have drained his blood and filled his brow
with lines and wrinkles when his youthful morn
hath travelled on to age's steepy night
and all those beauties whereof now he's king
are vanishing or vanished out of sight
stealing away the treasure of his spring  
for such a time do i now fortify
against confounding age's cruel knife
that he shall never cut from memory
my sweet love's beauty though my lover's life
his beauty shall in these black lines be seen
and they shall live and he in them still green

when i have seen by time's fell hand defaced
the rich-proud cost of outworn buried age
when sometime lofty towers i see down-rased
and brass eternal slave to mortal rage
when i have seen the hungry ocean gain
advantage on the kingdom of the shore
and the firm soil win of the watery main
increasing store with loss and loss with store
when i have seen such interchange of state
or state it self confounded to decay
ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate
that time will come and take my love away  
this thought is as a death which cannot choose
but weep to have that which it fears to lose

since brass nor stone nor earth nor boundless sea
but sad mortality o'ersways their power
how with this rage shall beauty hold a plea
whose action is no stronger than a flower
o how shall summer's honey breath hold out
against the wrackful siege of batt'ring days
when rocks impregnable are not so stout
nor gates of steel so strong but time decays
o fearful meditation where alack
shall time's best jewel from time's chest lie hid
or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back
or who his spoil of beauty can forbid
o none unless this miracle have might
that in black ink my love may still shine bright
  
tired with all these for restful death i cry
as to behold desert a beggar born
and needy nothing trimmed in jollity
and purest faith unhappily forsworn
and gilded honour shamefully misplaced
and maiden virtue rudely strumpeted
and right perfection wrongfully disgraced
and strength by limping sway disabled
and art made tongue-tied by authority
and folly doctor-like controlling skill
and simple truth miscalled simplicity
and captive good attending captain ill
tired with all these from these would i be gone
save that to die i leave my love alone

ah wherefore with infection should he live
and with his presence grace impiety
that sin by him advantage should achieve
and lace it self with his society  
why should false painting imitate his cheek
and steal dead seeming of his living hue
why should poor beauty indirectly seek
roses of shadow since his rose is true
why should he live now nature bankrupt is
beggared of blood to blush through lively veins
for she hath no exchequer now but his
and proud of many lives upon his gains
o him she stores to show what wealth she had
in days long since before these last so bad

thus is his cheek the map of days outworn
when beauty lived and died as flowers do now
before these bastard signs of fair were born
or durst inhabit on a living brow
before the golden tresses of the dead
the right of sepulchres were shorn away
to live a second life on second head
ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay  
in him those holy antique hours are seen
without all ornament it self and true
making no summer of another's green
robbing no old to dress his beauty new
and him as for a map doth nature store
to show false art what beauty was of yore

those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view
want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend
all tongues the voice of souls give thee that due
uttering bare truth even so as foes commend
thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned
but those same tongues that give thee so thine own
in other accents do this praise confound
by seeing farther than the eye hath shown
they look into the beauty of thy mind
and that in guess they measure by thy deeds
then churls their thoughts although their eyes were kind
to thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds  
but why thy odour matcheth not thy show
the soil is this that thou dost common grow



that thou art blamed shall not be thy defect
for slander's mark was ever yet the fair
the ornament of beauty is suspect
a crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air
so thou be good slander doth but approve
thy worth the greater being wooed of time
for canker vice the sweetest buds doth love
and thou present'st a pure unstained prime
thou hast passed by the ambush of young days
either not assailed or victor being charged
yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise
to tie up envy evermore enlarged
if some suspect of ill masked not thy show
then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe


  
no longer mourn for me when i am dead
than you shall hear the surly sullen bell
give warning to the world that i am fled
from this vile world with vilest worms to dwell
nay if you read this line remember not
the hand that writ it for i love you so
that i in your sweet thoughts would be forgot
if thinking on me then should make you woe
o if i say you look upon this verse
when i perhaps compounded am with clay
do not so much as my poor name rehearse;
but let your love even with my life decay
lest the wise world should look into your moan
and mock you with me after i am gone



o lest the world should task you to recite
what merit lived in me that you should love
after my death dear love forget me quite
for you in me can nothing worthy prove  
unless you would devise some virtuous lie
to do more for me than mine own desert
and hang more praise upon deceased i
than niggard truth would willingly impart
o lest your true love may seem false in this
that you for love speak well of me untrue
my name be buried where my body is
and live no more to shame nor me nor you
for i am shamed by that which i bring forth
and so should you to love things nothing worth



that time of year thou mayst in me behold
when yellow leaves or none or few do hang
upon those boughs which shake against the cold
bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang
in me thou seest the twilight of such day
as after sunset fadeth in the west
which by and by black night doth take away
death's second self that seals up all in rest  
in me thou seest the glowing of such fire
that on the ashes of his youth doth lie
as the death-bed whereon it must expire
consumed with that which it was nourished by
this thou perceiv'st which makes thy love more strong
to love that well which thou must leave ere long



but be contented when that fell arrest
without all bail shall carry me away
my life hath in this line some interest
which for memorial still with thee shall stay
when thou reviewest this thou dost review
the very part was consecrate to thee
the earth can have but earth which is his due
my spirit is thine the better part of me
so then thou hast but lost the dregs of life
the prey of worms my body being dead
the coward conquest of a wretch's knife
too base of thee to be remembered  
the worth of that is that which it contains
and that is this and this with thee remains



so are you to my thoughts as food to life
or as sweet-seasoned showers are to the ground;
and for the peace of you i hold such strife
as 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found
now proud as an enjoyer and anon
doubting the filching age will steal his treasure
now counting best to be with you alone
then bettered that the world may see my pleasure
sometime all full with feasting on your sight
and by and by clean starved for a look
possessing or pursuing no delight
save what is had or must from you be took
thus do i pine and surfeit day by day
or gluttoning on all or all away


  
why is my verse so barren of new pride
so far from variation or quick change
why with the time do i not glance aside
to new-found methods and to compounds strange
why write i still all one ever the same
and keep invention in a noted weed
that every word doth almost tell my name
showing their birth and where they did proceed
o know sweet love i always write of you
and you and love are still my argument
so all my best is dressing old words new
spending again what is already spent
for as the sun is daily new and old
so is my love still telling what is told



thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear
thy dial how thy precious minutes waste
these vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear
and of this book this learning mayst thou taste  
the wrinkles which thy glass will truly show
of mouthed graves will give thee memory
thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know
time's thievish progress to eternity
look what thy memory cannot contain
commit to these waste blanks and thou s
