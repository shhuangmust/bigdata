halt find
those children nursed delivered from thy brain
to take a new acquaintance of thy mind
these offices so oft as thou wilt look
shall profit thee and much enrich thy book



so oft have i invoked thee for my muse
and found such fair assistance in my verse
as every alien pen hath got my use
and under thee their poesy disperse
thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing
and heavy ignorance aloft to fly
have added feathers to the learned's wing
and given grace a double majesty
yet be most proud of that which i compile
whose influence is thine and born of thee
in others' works thou dost but mend the style
and arts with thy sweet graces graced be
but thou art all my art and dost advance
as high as learning my rude ignorance



whilst i alone did call upon thy aid
my verse alone had all thy gentle grace
but now my gracious numbers are decayed
and my sick muse doth give an other place
i grant sweet love thy lovely argument
deserves the travail of a worthier pen
yet what of thee thy poet doth invent
he robs thee of and pays it thee again
he lends thee virtue and he stole that word
from thy behaviour beauty doth he give
and found it in thy cheek he can afford
no praise to thee but what in thee doth live  
then thank him not for that which he doth say
since what he owes thee thou thy self dost pay



o how i faint when i of you do write
knowing a better spirit doth use your name
and in the praise thereof spends all his might
to make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame
but since your worth wide as the ocean is
the humble as the proudest sail doth bear
my saucy bark inferior far to his
on your broad main doth wilfully appear
your shallowest help will hold me up afloat
whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride
or being wrecked i am a worthless boat
he of tall building and of goodly pride
then if he thrive and i be cast away
the worst was this my love was my decay


  
or i shall live your epitaph to make
or you survive when i in earth am rotten
from hence your memory death cannot take
although in me each part will be forgotten
your name from hence immortal life shall have
though i once gone to all the world must die
the earth can yield me but a common grave
when you entombed in men's eyes shall lie
your monument shall be my gentle verse
which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read
and tongues to be your being shall rehearse
when all the breathers of this world are dead
you still shall live such virtue hath my pen
where breath most breathes even in the mouths of men



i grant thou wert not married to my muse
and therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook
the dedicated words which writers use
of their fair subject blessing every book  
thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue
finding thy worth a limit past my praise
and therefore art enforced to seek anew
some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days
and do so love yet when they have devised
what strained touches rhetoric can lend
thou truly fair wert truly sympathized
in true plain words by thy true-telling friend
and their gross painting might be better used
where cheeks need blood in thee it is abused



i never saw that you did painting need
and therefore to your fair no painting set
i found or thought i found you did exceed
that barren tender of a poet's debt
and therefore have i slept in your report
that you your self being extant well might show
how far a modern quill doth come too short
speaking of worth what worth in you doth grow  
this silence for my sin you did impute
which shall be most my glory being dumb
for i impair not beauty being mute
when others would give life and bring a tomb
there lives more life in one of your fair eyes
than both your poets can in praise devise



who is it that says most which can say more
than this rich praise that you alone are you
in whose confine immured is the store
which should example where your equal grew
lean penury within that pen doth dwell
that to his subject lends not some small glory
but he that writes of you if he can tell
that you are you so dignifies his story
let him but copy what in you is writ
not making worse what nature made so clear
and such a counterpart shall fame his wit
making his style admired every where  
you to your beauteous blessings add a curse
being fond on praise which makes your praises worse



my tongue-tied muse in manners holds her still
while comments of your praise richly compiled
reserve their character with golden quill
and precious phrase by all the muses filed
i think good thoughts whilst other write good words
and like unlettered clerk still cry amen
to every hymn that able spirit affords
in polished form of well refined pen
hearing you praised i say 'tis so 'tis true
and to the most of praise add something more
but that is in my thought whose love to you
though words come hindmost holds his rank before
then others for the breath of words respect
me for my dumb thoughts speaking in effect


  
was it the proud full sail of his great verse
bound for the prize of all too precious you
that did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse
making their tomb the womb wherein they grew
was it his spirit by spirits taught to write
above a mortal pitch that struck me dead
no neither he nor his compeers by night
giving him aid my verse astonished
he nor that affable familiar ghost
which nightly gulls him with intelligence
as victors of my silence cannot boast
i was not sick of any fear from thence
but when your countenance filled up his line
then lacked i matter that enfeebled mine



farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing
and like enough thou know'st thy estimate
the charter of thy worth gives thee releasing
my bonds in thee are all determinate  
for how do i hold thee but by thy granting
and for that riches where is my deserving
the cause of this fair gift in me is wanting
and so my patent back again is swerving
thy self thou gav'st thy own worth then not knowing
or me to whom thou gav'st it else mistaking
so thy great gift upon misprision growing
comes home again on better judgement making
thus have i had thee as a dream doth flatter
in sleep a king but waking no such matter



when thou shalt be disposed to set me light
and place my merit in the eye of scorn
upon thy side against my self i'll fight
and prove thee virtuous though thou art forsworn
with mine own weakness being best acquainted
upon thy part i can set down a story
of faults concealed wherein i am attainted
that thou in losing me shalt win much glory  
and i by this will be a gainer too
for bending all my loving thoughts on thee
the injuries that to my self i do
doing thee vantage double-vantage me
such is my love to thee i so belong
that for thy right my self will bear all wrong



say that thou didst forsake me for some fault
and i will comment upon that offence
speak of my lameness and i straight will halt
against thy reasons making no defence
thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill
to set a form upon desired change
as i'll my self disgrace knowing thy will
i will acquaintance strangle and look strange
be absent from thy walks and in my tongue
thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell
lest i too much profane should do it wronk
and haply of our old acquaintance tell  
for thee against my self i'll vow debate
for i must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate



then hate me when thou wilt if ever now
now while the world is bent my deeds to cross
join with the spite of fortune make me bow
and do not drop in for an after-loss
ah do not when my heart hath 'scaped this sorrow
come in the rearward of a conquered woe
give not a windy night a rainy morrow
to linger out a purposed overthrow
if thou wilt leave me do not leave me last
when other petty griefs have done their spite
but in the onset come so shall i taste
at first the very worst of fortune's might
and other strains of woe which now seem woe
compared with loss of thee will not seem so


  
some glory in their birth some in their skill
some in their wealth some in their body's force
some in their garments though new-fangled ill
some in their hawks and hounds some in their horse
and every humour hath his adjunct pleasure
wherein it finds a joy above the rest
but these particulars are not my measure
all these i better in one general best
thy love is better than high birth to me
richer than wealth prouder than garments' costs
of more delight than hawks and horses be
and having thee of all men's pride i boast
wretched in this alone that thou mayst take
all this away and me most wretchcd make



but do thy worst to steal thy self away
for term of life thou art assured mine
and life no longer than thy love will stay
for it depends upon that love of thine  
then need i not to fear the worst of wrongs
when in the least of them my life hath end
i see a better state to me belongs
than that which on thy humour doth depend
thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind
since that my life on thy revolt doth lie
o what a happy title do i find
happy to have thy love happy to die!
but what's so blessed-fair that fears no blot
thou mayst be false and yet i know it not



so shall i live supposing thou art true
like a deceived husband so love's face
may still seem love to me though altered new
thy looks with me thy heart in other place
for there can live no hatred in thine eye
therefore in that i cannot know thy change
in many's looks the false heart's history
is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange  
but heaven in thy creation did decree
that in thy face sweet love should ever dwell
whate'er thy thoughts or thy heart's workings be
thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell
how like eve's apple doth thy beauty grow
if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show



they that have power to hurt and will do none
that do not do the thing they most do show
who moving others are themselves as stone
unmoved cold and to temptation slow
they rightly do inherit heaven's graces
and husband nature's riches from expense
tibey are the lords and owners of their faces
others but stewards of their excellence
the summer's flower is to the summer sweet
though to it self it only live and die
but if that flower with base infection meet
the basest weed outbraves his dignity  
for sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds
lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds



how sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame
which like a canker in the fragrant rose
doth spot the beauty of thy budding name!
o in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose!
that tongue that tells the story of thy days
making lascivious comments on thy sport
cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise
naming thy name blesses an ill report
o what a mansion have those vices got
which for their habitation chose out thee
where beauty's veil doth cover every blot
and all things turns to fair that eyes can see!
take heed dear heart of this large privilege
the hardest knife ill-used doth lose his edge


  
some say thy fault is youth some wantonness
some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport
both grace and faults are loved of more and less
thou mak'st faults graces that to thee resort
as on the finger of a throned queen
the basest jewel will be well esteemed
so are those errors that in thee are seen
to truths translated and for true things deemed
how many lambs might the stern wolf betray
if like a lamb he could his looks translate!
how many gazers mightst thou lead away
if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!
but do not so i love thee in such sort
as thou being mine mine is thy good report



how like a winter hath my absence been
from thee the pleasure of the fleeting year!
what freezings have i felt what dark days seen!
what old december's bareness everywhere!  
and yet this time removed was summer's time
the teeming autumn big with rich increase
bearing the wanton burden of the prime
like widowed wombs after their lords' decease
yet this abundant issue seemed to me
but hope of orphans and unfathered fruit
for summer and his pleasures wait on thee
and thou away the very birds are mute
or if they sing 'tis with so dull a cheer
that leaves look pale dreading the winter's near



from you have i been absent in the spring
when proud-pied april dressed in all his trim
hath put a spirit of youth in every thing
that heavy saturn laughed and leaped with him
yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell
of different flowers in odour and in hue
could make me any summer's story tell
or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew  
nor did i wonder at the lily's white
nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose
they were but sweet but figures of delight
drawn after you you pattern of all those
yet seemed it winter still and you away
as with your shadow i with these did play



the forward violet thus did i chide
sweet thief whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells
if not from my love's breath the purple pride
which on thy soft check for complexion dwells
in my love's veins thou hast too grossly dyed
the lily i condemned for thy hand
and buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair
the roses fearfully on thorns did stand
one blushing shame another white despair
a third nor red nor white had stol'n of both
and to his robbery had annexed thy breath
but for his theft in pride of all his growth  
a vengeful canker eat him up to death
more flowers i noted yet i none could see
but sweet or colour it had stol'n from thee



where art thou muse that thou forget'st so long
to speak of that which gives thee all thy might
spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song
darkening thy power to lend base subjects light
return forgetful muse and straight redeem
in gentle numbers time so idly spent
sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem
and gives thy pen both skill and argument
rise resty muse my love's sweet face survey
if time have any wrinkle graven there
if any be a satire to decay
and make time's spoils despised everywhere
give my love fame faster than time wastes life
so thou prevent'st his scythe and crooked knife



o truant muse what shall be thy amends
for thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed
both truth and beauty on my love depends
so dost thou too and therein dignified
make answer muse wilt thou not haply say
'truth needs no colour with his colour fixed
beauty no pencil beauty's truth to lay
but best is best if never intermixed'
because he needs no praise wilt thou be dumb
excuse not silence so for't lies in thee
to make him much outlive a gilded tomb
and to be praised of ages yet to be
then do thy office muse i teach thee how
to make him seem long hence as he shows now



my love is strengthened though more weak in seeming
i love not less though less the show appear
that love is merchandized whose rich esteeming  
the owner's tongue doth publish every where
our love was new and then but in the spring
when i was wont to greet it with my lays
as philomel in summer's front doth sing
and stops her pipe in growth of riper days
not that the summer is less pleasant now
than when her mournful hymns did hush the night
but that wild music burthens every bough
and sweets grown common lose their dear delight
therefore like her i sometime hold my tongue
because i would not dull you with my song



alack what poverty my muse brings forth
that having such a scope to show her pride
the argument all bare is of more worth
than when it hath my added praise beside
o blame me not if i no more can write!
look in your glass and there appears a face
that over-goes my blunt invention quite  
dulling my lines and doing me disgrace
were it not sinful then striving to mend
to mar the subject that before was well
for to no other pass my verses tend
than of your graces and your gifts to tell
and more much more than in my verse can sit
your own glass shows you when you look in it



to me fair friend you never can be old
for as you were when first your eye i eyed
such seems your beauty still three winters cold
have from the forests shook three summers' pride
three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned
in process of the seasons have i seen
three april perfumes in three hot junes burned
since first i saw you fresh which yet are green
ah yet doth beauty like a dial hand
steal from his figure and no pace perceived
so your sweet hue which methinks still doth stand  
hath motion and mine eye may be deceived
for fear of which hear this thou age unbred
ere you were born was beauty's summer dead



let not my love be called idolatry
nor my beloved as an idol show
since all alike my songs and praises be
to one of one still such and ever so
kind is my love to-day to-morrow kind
still constant in a wondrous excellence
therefore my verse to constancy confined
one thing expressing leaves out difference
fair kind and true is all my argument
fair kind and true varying to other words
and in this change is my invention spent
three themes in one which wondrous scope affords
fair kind and true have often lived alone
which three till now never kept seat in one



when in the chronicle of wasted time
i see descriptions of the fairest wights
and beauty making beautiful old rhyme
in praise of ladies dead and lovely knights
then in the blazon of sweet beauty's best
of hand of foot of lip of eye of brow
i see their antique pen would have expressed
even such a beauty as you master now
so all their praises are but prophecies
of this our time all you prefiguring
and for they looked but with divining eyes
they had not skill enough your worth to sing
for we which now behold these present days
have eyes to wonder but lack tongues to praise



not mine own fears nor the prophetic soul
of the wide world dreaming on things to come
can yet the lease of my true love control  
supposed as forfeit to a confined doom
the mortal moon hath her eclipse endured
and the sad augurs mock their own presage
incertainties now crown themselves assured
and peace proclaims olives of endless age
now with the drops of this most balmy time
my love looks fresh and death to me subscribes
since spite of him i'll live in this poor rhyme
while he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes
and thou in this shalt find thy monument
when tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent



what's in the brain that ink may character
which hath not figured to thee my true spirit
what's new to speak what now to register
that may express my love or thy dear merit
nothing sweet boy but yet like prayers divine
i must each day say o'er the very same
counting no old thing old thou mine i thine  
even as when first i hallowed thy fair name
so that eternal love in love's fresh case
weighs not the dust and injury of age
nor gives to necessary wrinkles place
but makes antiquity for aye his page
finding the first conceit of love there bred
where time and outward form would show it dead



o never say that i was false of heart
though absence seemed my flame to qualify
as easy might i from my self depart
as from my soul which in thy breast doth lie
that is my home of love if i have ranged
like him that travels i return again
just to the time not with the time exchanged
so that my self bring water for my stain
never believe though in my nature reigned
all frailties that besiege all kinds of blood
that it could so preposterously be stained  
to leave for nothing all thy sum of good
for nothing this wide universe i call
save thou my rose in it thou art my all



alas 'tis true i have gone here and there
and made my self a motley to the view
gored mine own thoughts sold cheap what is most dear
made old offences of affections new
most true it is that i have looked on truth
askance and strangely but by all above
these blenches gave my heart another youth
and worse essays proved thee my best of love
now all is done have what shall have no end
mine appetite i never more will grind
on newer proof to try an older friend
a god in love to whom i am confined
then give me welcome next my heaven the best
even to thy pure and most most loving breast



o for my sake do you with fortune chide
the guilty goddess of my harmful deeds
that did not better for my life provide
than public means which public manners breeds
thence comes it that my name receives a brand
and almost thence my nature is subdued
to what it works in like the dyer's hand
pity me then and wish i were renewed
whilst like a willing patient i will drink
potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection
no bitterness that i will bitter think
nor double penance to correct correction
pity me then dear friend and i assure ye
even that your pity is enough to cure me



your love and pity doth th' impression fill
which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow
for what care i who calls me well or ill  
so you o'er-green my bad my good allow
you are my all the world and i must strive
to know my shames and praises from your tongue
none else to me nor i to none alive
that my steeled sense or changes right or wrong
in so profound abysm i throw all care
of others' voices that my adder's sense
to critic and to flatterer stopped are
mark how with my neglect i do dispense
you are so strongly in my purpose bred
that all the world besides methinks are dead



since i left you mine eye is in my mind
and that which governs me to go about
doth part his function and is partly blind
seems seeing but effectually is out
for it no form delivers to the heart
of bird of flower or shape which it doth latch
of his quick objects hath the mind no part  
nor his own vision holds what it doth catch
for if it see the rud'st or gentlest sight
the most sweet favour or deformed'st creature
the mountain or the sea the day or night
the crow or dove it shapes them to your feature
incapable of more replete with you
my most true mind thus maketh mine untrue



or whether doth my mind being crowned with you
drink up the monarch's plague this flattery
or whether shall i say mine eye saith true
and that your love taught it this alchemy
to make of monsters and things indigest
such cherubins as your sweet self resemble
creating every bad a perfect best
as fast as objects to his beams assemble
o 'tis the first 'tis flattery in my seeing
and my great mind most kingly drinks it up
mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing  
and to his palate doth prepare the cup
if it be poisoned 'tis the lesser sin
that mine eye loves it and doth first begin



those lines that i before have writ do lie
even those that said i could not love you dearer
yet then my judgment knew no reason why
my most full flame should afterwards burn clearer
but reckoning time whose millioned accidents
creep in 'twixt vows and change decrees of kings
tan sacred beauty blunt the sharp'st intents
divert strong minds to the course of alt'ring things
alas why fearing of time's tyranny
might i not then say 'now i love you best'
when i was certain o'er incertainty
crowning the present doubting of the rest
love is a babe then might i not say so
to give full growth to that which still doth grow



let me not to the marriage of true minds
admit impediments love is not love
which alters when it alteration finds
or bends with the remover to remove
o no it is an ever-fixed mark
that looks on tempests and is never shaken;
it is the star to every wand'ring bark
whose worth's unknown although his height be taken
love's not time's fool though rosy lips and cheeks
within his bending sickle's compass come
love alters not with his brief hours and weeks
but bears it out even to the edge of doom
if this be error and upon me proved
i never writ nor no man ever loved



accuse me thus that i have scanted all
wherein i should your great deserts repay
forgot upon your dearest love to call  
whereto all bonds do tie me day by day
that i have frequent been with unknown minds
and given to time your own dear-purchased right
that i have hoisted sail to all the winds
which should transport me farthest from your sight
book both my wilfulness and errors down
and on just proof surmise accumulate
bring me within the level of your frown
but shoot not at me in your wakened hate
since my appeal says i did strive to prove
the constancy and virtue of your love



like as to make our appetite more keen
with eager compounds we our palate urge
as to prevent our maladies unseen
we sicken to shun sickness when we purge
even so being full of your ne'er-cloying sweetness
to bitter sauces did i frame my feeding;
and sick of welfare found a kind of meetness  
to be diseased ere that there was true needing
thus policy in love t' anticipate
the ills that were not grew to faults assured
and brought to medicine a healthful state
which rank of goodness would by ill be cured
but thence i learn and find the lesson true
drugs poison him that so feil sick of you



what potions have i drunk of siren tears
distilled from limbecks foul as hell within
applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears
still losing when i saw my self to win!
what wretched errors hath my heart committed
whilst it hath thought it self so blessed never!
how have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted
in the distraction of this madding fever!
o benefit of ill now i find true
that better is by evil still made better
and ruined love when it is built anew  
grows fairer than at first more strong far greater
so i return rebuked to my content
and gain by ills thrice more than i have spent



that you were once unkind befriends me now
and for that sorrow which i then did feel
needs must i under my transgression bow
unless my nerves were brass or hammered steel
for if you were by my unkindness shaken
as i by yours y'have passed a hell of time
and i a tyrant have no leisure taken
to weigh how once i suffered in your crime
o that our night of woe might have remembered
my deepest sense how hard true sorrow hits
and soon to you as you to me then tendered
the humble salve which wounded bosoms fits!
but that your trespass now becomes a fee
mine ransoms yours and yours must ransom me



'tis better to be vile than vile esteemed
when not to be receives reproach of being
and the just pleasure lost which is so deemed
not by our feeling but by others' seeing
for why should others' false adulterate eyes
give salutation to my sportive blood
or on my frailties why are frailer spies
which in their wills count bad what i think good
no i am that i am and they that level
at my abuses reckon up their own
i may be straight though they themselves be bevel;
by their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown
unless this general evil they maintain
all men are bad and in their badness reign



thy gift thy tables are within my brain
full charactered with lasting memory
which shall above that idle rank remain  
beyond all date even to eternity
or at the least so long as brain and heart
have faculty by nature to subsist
till each to razed oblivion yield his part
of thee thy record never can be missed
that poor retention could not so much hold
nor need i tallies thy dear love to score
therefore to give them from me was i bold
to trust those tables that receive thee more
to keep an adjunct to remember thee
were to import forgetfulness in me



no! time thou shalt not boast that i do change
thy pyramids built up with newer might
to me are nothing novel nothing strange
they are but dressings of a former sight
our dates are brief and therefore we admire
what thou dost foist upon us that is old
and rather make them born to our desire  
than think that we before have heard them told
thy registers and thee i both defy
not wond'ring at the present nor the past
for thy records and what we see doth lie
made more or less by thy continual haste
this i do vow and this shall ever be
i will be true despite thy scythe and thee



if my dear love were but the child of state
it might for fortune's bastard be unfathered
as subject to time's love or to time's hate
weeds among weeds or flowers with flowers gathered
no it was builded far from accident
it suffers not in smiling pomp nor falls
under the blow of thralled discontent
whereto th' inviting time our fashion calls
it fears not policy that heretic
which works on leases of short-numbered hours
but all alone stands hugely politic  
that it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers
to this i witness call the fools of time
which die for goodness who have lived for crime



were't aught to me i bore the canopy
with my extern the outward honouring
or laid great bases for eternity
which proves more short than waste or ruining
have i not seen dwellers on form and favour
lose all and more by paying too much rent
for compound sweet; forgoing simple savour
pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent
no let me be obsequious in thy heart
and take thou my oblation poor but free
which is not mixed with seconds knows no art
but mutual render only me for thee
hence thou suborned informer a true soul
when most impeached stands least in thy control



o thou my lovely boy who in thy power
dost hold time's fickle glass his fickle hour
who hast by waning grown and therein show'st
thy lovers withering as thy sweet self grow'st
if nature sovereign mistress over wrack
as thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back
she keeps thee to this purpose that her skill
may time disgrace and wretched minutes kill
yet fear her o thou minion of her pleasure
she may detain but not still keep her treasure!
her audit though delayed answered must be
and her quietus is to render thee



in the old age black was not counted fair
or if it were it bore not beauty's name
but now is black beauty's successive heir
and beauty slandered with a bastard shame
for since each hand hath put on nature's power  
fairing the foul with art's false borrowed face
sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower
but is profaned if not lives in disgrace
therefore my mistress' eyes are raven black
her eyes so suited and they mourners seem
at such who not born fair no beauty lack
slandering creation with a false esteem
yet so they mourn becoming of their woe
that every tongue says beauty should look so



how oft when thou my music music play'st
upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds
with thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway'st
the wiry concord that mine ear confounds
do i envy those jacks that nimble leap
to kiss the tender inward of thy hand
whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap
at the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand
to be so tickled they would change their state  
and situation with those dancing chips
o'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait
making dead wood more blest than living lips
since saucy jacks so happy are in this
give them thy fingers me thy lips to kiss



th' expense of spirit in a waste of shame
is lust in action and till action lust
is perjured murd'rous bloody full of blame
savage extreme rude cruel not to trust
enjoyed no sooner but despised straight
past reason hunted and no sooner had
past reason hated as a swallowed bait
on purpose laid to make the taker mad
mad in pursuit and in possession so
had having and in quest to have extreme
a bliss in proof and proved a very woe
before a joy proposed behind a dream
all this the world well knows yet none knows well  
to shun the heaven that leads men to this hell



my mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun
coral is far more red than her lips red
if snow be white why then her breasts are dun
if hairs be wires black wires grow on her head
i have seen roses damasked red and white
but no such roses see i in her cheeks
and in some perfumes is there more delight
than in the breath that from my mistress reeks
i love to hear her speak yet well i know
that music hath a far more pleasing sound
i grant i never saw a goddess go
my mistress when she walks treads on the ground
and yet by heaven i think my love as rare
as any she belied with false compare



thou art as tyrannous so as thou art  
as those whose beauties proudly make them cruel;
for well thou know'st to my dear doting heart
thou art the fairest and most precious jewel
yet in good faith some say that thee behold
thy face hath not the power to make love groan;
to say they err i dare not be so bold
although i swear it to my self alone
and to be sure that is not false i swear
a thousand groans but thinking on thy face
one on another's neck do witness bear
thy black is fairest in my judgment's place
in nothing art thou black save in thy deeds
and thence this slander as i think proceeds



thine eyes i love and they as pitying me
knowing thy heart torment me with disdain
have put on black and loving mourners be
looking with pretty ruth upon my pain
and truly not the morning sun of heaven  
better becomes the grey cheeks of the east
nor that full star that ushers in the even
doth half that glory to the sober west
as those two mourning eyes become thy face
o let it then as well beseem thy heart
to mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace
and suit thy pity like in every part
then will i swear beauty herself is black
and all they foul that thy complexion lack



beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
for that deep wound it gives my friend and me;
is't not enough to torture me alone
but slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be
me from my self thy cruel eye hath taken
and my next self thou harder hast engrossed
of him my self and thee i am forsaken
a torment thrice three-fold thus to be crossed
prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward  
but then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail
whoe'er keeps me let my heart be his guard
thou canst not then use rigour in my gaol
and yet thou wilt for i being pent in thee
perforce am thine and all that is in me



so now i have confessed that he is thine
and i my self am mortgaged to thy will
my self i'll forfeit so that other mine
thou wilt restore to be my comfort still
but thou wilt not nor he will not be free
for thou art covetous and he is kind
he learned but surety-like to write for me
under that bond that him as fist doth bind
the statute of thy beauty thou wilt take
thou usurer that put'st forth all to use
and sue a friend came debtor for my sake
so him i lose through my unkind abuse
him have i lost thou hast both him and me  
he pays the whole and yet am i not free



whoever hath her wish thou hast thy will
and 'will' to boot and 'will' in over-plus
more than enough am i that vex thee still
to thy sweet will making addition thus
wilt thou whose will is large and spacious
not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine
shall will in others seem right gracious
and in my will no fair acceptance shine
the sea all water yet receives rain still
and in abundance addeth to his store
so thou being rich in will add to thy will
one will of mine to make thy large will more
let no unkind no fair beseechers kill
think all but one and me in that one 'will'



if thy soul check thee that i come so near  
swear to thy blind soul that i was thy 'will'
and will thy soul knows is admitted there
thus far for love my love-suit sweet fulfil
'will' will fulfil the treasure of thy love
ay fill it full with wills and my will one
in things of great receipt with case we prove
among a number one is reckoned none
then in the number let me pass untold
though in thy store's account i one must be
for nothing hold me so it please thee hold
that nothing me a something sweet to thee
make but my name thy love and love that still
and then thou lov'st me for my name is will



thou blind fool love what dost thou to mine eyes
that they behold and see not what they see
they know what beauty is see where it lies
yet what the best is take the worst to be
if eyes corrupt by over-partial looks  
be anchored in the bay where all men ride
why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks
whereto the judgment of my heart is tied
why should my heart think that a several plot
which my heart knows the wide world's common place
or mine eyes seeing this say this is not
to put fair truth upon so foul a face
in things right true my heart and eyes have erred
and to this false plague are they now transferred



when my love swears that she is made of truth
i do believe her though i know she lies
that she might think me some untutored youth
unlearned in the world's false subtleties
thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young
although she knows my days are past the best
simply i credit her false-speaking tongue
on both sides thus is simple truth suppressed
but wherefore says she not she is unjust  
and wherefore say not i that i am old
o love's best habit is in seeming trust
and age in love loves not to have years told
therefore i lie with her and she with me
and in our faults by lies we flattered be



o call not me to justify the wrong
that thy unkindness lays upon my heart
wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue
use power with power and slay me not by art
tell me thou lov'st elsewhere; but in my sight
dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside
what need'st thou wound with cunning when thy might
is more than my o'erpressed defence can bide
let me excuse thee ah my love well knows
her pretty looks have been mine enemies
and therefore from my face she turns my foes
that they elsewhere might dart their injuries
yet do not so but since i am near slain  
kill me outright with looks and rid my pain



be wise as thou art cruel do not press
my tongue-tied patience with too much disdain
lest sorrow lend me words and words express
the manner of my pity-wanting pain
if i might teach thee wit better it were
though not to love yet love to tell me so
as testy sick men when their deaths be near
no news but health from their physicians know
for if i should despair i should grow mad
and in my madness might speak ill of thee
now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad
mad slanderers by mad ears believed be
that i may not be so nor thou belied
bear thine eyes straight though thy proud heart go wide



in faith i do not love thee with mine eyes  
for they in thee a thousand errors note
but 'tis my heart that loves what they despise
who in despite of view is pleased to dote
nor are mine cars with thy tongue's tune delighted
nor tender feeling to base touches prone
nor taste nor smell desire to be invited
to any sensual feast with thee alone
but my five wits nor my five senses can
dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee
who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man
thy proud heart's slave and vassal wretch to be
only my plague thus far i count my gain
that she that makes me sin awards me pain



love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate
hate of my sin grounded on sinful loving
o but with mine compare thou thine own state
and thou shalt find it merits not reproving
or if it do not from those lips of thine  
that have profaned their scarlet ornaments
and sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine
robbed others' beds' revenues of their rents
be it lawful i love thee as thou lov'st those
whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee
root pity in thy heart that when it grows
thy pity may deserve to pitied be
if thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide
by self-example mayst thou be denied



lo as a careful huswife runs to catch
one of her feathered creatures broke away
sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch
in pursuit of the thing she would have stay
whilst her neglected child holds her in chase
cries to catch her whose busy care is bent
to follow that which flies before her face
not prizing her poor infant's discontent;
so run'st thou after that which flies from thee  
whilst i thy babe chase thee afar behind
but if thou catch thy hope turn back to me
and play the mother's part kiss me be kind
so will i pray that thou mayst have thy will
if thou turn back and my loud crying still



two loves i have of comfort and despair
which like two spirits do suggest me still
the better angel is a man right fair
the worser spirit a woman coloured ill
to win me soon to hell my female evil
tempteth my better angel from my side
and would corrupt my saint to be a devil
wooing his purity with her foul pride
and whether that my angel be turned fiend
suspect i may yet not directly tell
but being both from me both to each friend
i guess one angel in another's hell
yet this shall i ne'er know but live in doubt  
till my bad angel fire my good one out



those lips that love's own hand did make
breathed forth the sound that said 'i hate'
to me that languished for her sake
but when she saw my woeful state
straight in her heart did mercy come
chiding that tongue that ever sweet
was used in giving gentle doom
and taught it thus anew to greet
'i hate' she altered with an end
that followed it as gentle day
doth follow night who like a fiend
from heaven to hell is flown away
'i hate' from hate away she threw
and saved my life saying 'not you'

poor soul the centre of my sinful earth  
my sinful earth these rebel powers array
why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth
painting thy outward walls so costly gay
why so large cost having so short a lease
dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend
shall worms inheritors of this excess
eat up thy charge is this thy body's end
then soul live thou upon thy servant's loss
and let that pine to aggravate thy store;
buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;
within be fed without be rich no more
so shall thou feed on death that feeds on men
and death once dead there's no more dying then

my love is as a fever longing still
for that which longer nurseth the disease
feeding on that which doth preserve the ill
th' uncertain sickly appetite to please
my reason the physician to my love  
angry that his prescriptions are not kept
hath left me and i desperate now approve
desire is death which physic did except
past cure i am now reason is past care
and frantic-mad with evermore unrest
my thoughts and my discourse as mad men's are
at random from the truth vainly expressed
for i have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright
who art as black as hell as dark as night

o me! what eyes hath love put in my head
which have no correspondence with true sight
or if they have where is my judgment fled
that censures falsely what they see aright
if that be fair whereon my false eyes dote
what means the world to say it is not so
if it be not then love doth well denote
love's eye is not so true as all men's no
how can it o how can love's eye be true  
that is so vexed with watching and with tears
no marvel then though i mistake my view
the sun it self sees not till heaven clears
o cunning love with tears thou keep'st me blind
lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find

canst thou o cruel say i love thee not
when i against my self with thee partake
do i not think on thee when i forgot
am of my self all-tyrant for thy sake
who hateth thee that i do call my friend
on whom frown'st thou that i do fawn upon
nay if thou lour'st on me do i not spend
revenge upon my self with present moan
what merit do i in my self respect
that is so proud thy service to despise
when all my best doth worship thy defect
commanded by the motion of thine eyes
but love hate on for now i know thy mind  
those that can see thou lov'st and i am blind

o from what power hast thou this powerful might
with insufficiency my heart to sway
to make me give the lie to my true sight
and swear that brightness doth not grace the day
whence hast thou this becoming of things ill
that in the very refuse of thy deeds
there is such strength and warrantise of skill
that in my mind thy worst all best exceeds
who taught thee how to make me love thee more
the more i hear and see just cause of hate
o though i love what others do abhor
with others thou shouldst not abhor my state
if thy unworthiness raised love in me
more worthy i to be beloved of thee

love is too young to know what conscience is  
yet who knows not conscience is born of love
then gentle cheater urge not my amiss
lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove
for thou betraying me i do betray
my nobler part to my gross body's treason
my soul doth tell my body that he may
triumph in love flesh stays no farther reason
but rising at thy name doth point out thee
as his triumphant prize proud of this pride
he is contented thy poor drudge to be
to stand in thy affairs fall by thy side
no want of conscience hold it that i call
her love for whose dear love i rise and fall

in loving thee thou know'st i am forsworn
but thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing
in act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn
in vowing new hate after new love bearing
but why of two oaths' breach do i accuse thee  
when i break twenty i am perjured most
for all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee
and all my honest faith in thee is lost
for i have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness
oaths of thy love thy truth thy constancy
and to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness
or made them swear against the thing they see
for i have sworn thee fair more perjured i
to swear against the truth so foul a be

cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep
a maid of dian's this advantage found
and his love-kindling fire did quickly steep
in a cold valley-fountain of that ground
which borrowed from this holy fire of love
a dateless lively heat still to endure
and grew a seeting bath which yet men prove
against strange maladies a sovereign cure
but at my mistress' eye love's brand new-fired  
the boy for trial needs would touch my breast
i sick withal the help of bath desired
and thither hied a sad distempered guest
but found no cure the bath for my help lies
where cupid got new fire; my mistress' eyes

the little love-god lying once asleep
laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand
whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep
came tripping by but in her maiden hand
the fairest votary took up that fire
which many legions of true hearts had warmed
and so the general of hot desire
was sleeping by a virgin hand disarmed
this brand she quenched in a cool well by
which from love's fire took heat perpetual
growing a bath and healthful remedy
for men discased but i my mistress' thrall
came there for cure and this by that i prove  
love's fire heats water water cools not love


                the end
